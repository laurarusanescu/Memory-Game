This is a basic implementation of the classic Memory Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players try to match pairs of hidden cards by flipping them over. The game features:

Card flipping functionality: Clicking a card reveals its image.
Matching logic: Correctly matched pairs stay revealed.
Restart button: Resets the game and shuffles card positions.
Help button (optional): Provides basic game instructions through a pop-up (can be commented out if not implemented).
